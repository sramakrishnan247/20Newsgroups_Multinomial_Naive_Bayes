# 20Newsgroups_Multinomial_Naive_Bayes
Python implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes for Text Classification on the 20NewsGroups dataset.

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups.
The dataset used is from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups.

This notebook(MNBayesClassifier.ipynb) can be run end to end by using Google Colab.

This was done as a part of COMS 573 Machine Learning at Iowa State University.
